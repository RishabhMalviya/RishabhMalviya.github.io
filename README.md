# Setup Steps
1. `ruby` (version 3.3.6) and `bundler` (came packaged with ruby) were installed using [`ruby-build`](https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build)
2. Further steps were followed from the official [GitHub Pages docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll)
3. The `_config.yml` was updated to use the [Slate theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/slate?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)
